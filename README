Donginger is a chatbot persona originally created for the Everything2.com website.
A few years ago, I moved it to the HellMOO RPG.

This project grew organically, I added features requested by players without thinking in the long term, my code became a mess. So I decided to Rewrite It From Scratch(tm).
My goal is to have it use an overly complex plugin system, to allow new features easily, without requiring modifications to the core code.

Features:
	* Can post to Twitter
	* Queries the Google Suggest API
	* Weather information based on location
	* Multiple databases support (MySQL, SQLite, etc.) thanks to SQLAlchemy

Requirements:
	* Python 2.6+
	* Python-Twitter (http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/)
	* lxml (http://lxml.de/)
	* SQLAlchemy 0.7 (http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
