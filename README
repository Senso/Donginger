Donginger is a chatbot persona originally created for the Everything2.com website.
A few years ago, I moved it to the HellMOO RPG.

This project grew organically, I added features requested by players without thinking in the long term, my code became a mess. So I decided to Rewrite It From Scratch(tm).
My goal is to have it use an overly complex plugin system, to allow new features easily, without requiring modifications to the core code.

Features:
	* Can post to Twitter.
	* Queries the Google Suggest API.
	* Weather information based on location.
	* Random markov chains from multiple bodies of text (none provided).
	* Multiple databases support (MySQL, SQLite, etc.) thanks to SQLAlchemy (not all tested yet).

Requirements:
	* Python 2.6+
	* Python-Twitter (http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/)
	* lxml (http://lxml.de/)
	* SQLAlchemy 0.7 (http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
	
Credits:
	* All original code by me (sensoz@gmail.com).
	* Some plugins were copy/pasted and adapted from the excellent Skybot (https://github.com/rmmh/skybot/)
	
Installation:

	* Install Python and needed modules (see above).
	* Edit conf/donginger.conf to make it point to your favorite server.
	* Edit conf/database.conf - currently I have only tested it with SQLite.
	* Edit the 'texts' block in conf/markov.conf, linking to your own text files.
	* Run it: <python donginger.py>
	* If you get errors, open a ticket and let me know what it is.
